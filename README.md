## Aprouch Taken
- I split the project into small portions to work on each and every one of them one by one  starting from
thinking how to work into finishing the whole project.
- I made the project dynamic and try to make it responisive as possible to all kind of devices.
- started to work at the stracture of the game and made it dynamic and based on the user's choice for a game mode.

## What to do next?
- Make it responsive for mobile devices.
- make it more dry code.
- maybe add some gif pictures.
